                <p className='top-details'>Hi! I am a self-taught front-end developer who spent 2022 learning to code and build web pages - and I'm so glad I did as web development has provided the professional spark that had been missing from my past experiences. I've never been as absorbed in anything as I have in solving a programming problem or building a web page from scratch.</p>
                <p>Having built dozens of websites and learned several languages and frameworks, I now look forward to bringing my passion for front-end development to a team doing interesting work. In the meantime, I'll be tackling projects from my wish list and tinkering with new libraries.</p>
